## Contributing to App Config

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

Below is a 'quick start' guide to developing. If there are details
that we are missing here, feel free to file an issue or correct mistakes!

### Building

We use `yarn`, and you should too if adding or removing any npm packages.

```
# installs third-party dependencies
yarn install

# builds all sub-packages
yarn build

# runs unit tests
yarn test

# runs our linter
yarn lint
```

### Pull Request

We will happily accept pull requests of any kind. Be sure that the tests
pass and that the linter is happy before filling a PR, otherwise we'll
need to tell you to fix those issues.

If you are adding anything new or changing behavior, please add applicable tests.
