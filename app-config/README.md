## Features

- **Schema Validation:** Avoid production typos. Write JSON Schema for your configuration, and we'll have your back.
- **Strong Typing:** Use it with TypeScript without separate validation. Types are generated based on JSON Schema constraints.
- **Powerful and Robust:** Flexible parsing extensions and file loading strategies. Provides file merging, environment specific values (eg. production vs development) and more.
- **First Class Encryption:** Manage your secrets in version control, backed by OpenPGP (optional). Or, keep secrets away from committed files with schema validation.
- **Use Your Tools:** Don't be constrained by your tools - export environment variables for usage anywhere.
- **Multi-Format:** Write YAML, TOML, JSON, JSON5 - whatever makes most sense for you.
